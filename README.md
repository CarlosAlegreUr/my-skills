*Meet Patritzio, your friendly neighborhood meta-architect!*

</div>

A meta-architecture for designing and generating bespoke AI tooling. Patritzio helps you:

- **Create** new skills-based architectures from scratch
- **Refactor** existing agents and tools into clean, composable designs
- **Extend** current architectures with new capabilities

### Workflow

| Phase | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Specify | `/specify` | Gather and formalize requirements conversationally |
| Design | `/design` | Derive primitives, compositions, and data contracts |
| Implement | `/implement` | Generate all architecture files |
| Review | `/review` | Validate, refine, and prepare for delivery |

Or just run **`/architect`** to go through all four phases end-to-end.

### What's Inside

- **20 primitive skills** — atomic, single-responsibility operations (gather requirements, derive primitives, design resilience, etc.)
- **4 composition skills** — workflow orchestrations that coordinate primitives across phases
- **6 commands** — user-facing shortcuts (`/architect`, `/specify`, `/design`, `/implement`, `/review`, `/optimize-models`)
- **21 knowledge base files** — principles, effectiveness patterns, design guides, reusable patterns, and QA resources

### Principles

Separation of Concerns · Single Responsibility · DRY · KISS · YAGNI · Loose Coupling · High Cohesion · Resilience by Default

**Get started:** Navigate to `agentic-solutions-architect/` or run `/architect`.

<summary><strong>Little Cheerful 😁📚 </strong> — a navigation-based continuous learning system</summary>

*You learn. The AI guides, questions, and verifies.*

</div>

An AI-powered learning assistant built for Claude Code that helps you build deep understanding through adaptive concept trees, Socratic questioning, and evidence-based explanations.

- **Learn any subject** — math, philosophy, history, sciences, languages, instruments, programming
- **Active learning over passive consumption** — Socratic questions before explanations, 3-option help loop, Feynman technique
- **Verified sources** — 3-attempt fetch protocol with configurable depth (Wikipedia through primary sources)
- **Adaptive concept trees** — dynamic breakdown of complex topics into manageable nodes (max ~50 per goal)
- **Multi-language support** — learn in any language

### How It Works

1. Configure your learning profile (tone, motivation, source depth, language)
2. State a learning goal
3. The system assesses your baseline, proposes a concept tree, and begins an active learning loop
4. Navigate freely, request breakdowns, and track progress across sessions

### What's Inside

- **2 commands** — `/start-learning`, learning techniques reference
- **2 specialized agents** — tree builder (generates concept trees with sources), concept breakdown (splits complex concepts on demand)
- **3 templates** — concept nodes, practice routines, session memory
- **Progress tracking** — minimal JSON-based state with human-readable markdown view

### Techniques

Socratic Method · Feynman Technique · Active Recall · Spaced Repetition · Progressive Disclosure

**Get started:** Copy `learning-agent/littleCheerful/` to `~/.claude/` and run `/start-learning`.
